# Stream Flutter: Building a Social Network with Stream and Flutter

In this post, we'll be creating a simple social network, called Stream Flutter, that allows a user to post messages to followers.

The app will allow a user to post a message to their followers and chat with them. Stream's [Activity Feed API](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/) and [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat) combined with Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) makes it straightforward to build this sort of complex interaction. All source code for this application is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nparsons08/flutter_the_stream). This application is fully functional on both iOS and Android.

For brevity, when we need to drop down to native code, we'll only focus on Android. You can find the corresponding iOS code to see how things are implemented.

Part 3 contains the final product. If you'd like to skip the tutorials and see the end result, please see the `README.md` in the `backend` and `frontend` directories on that branch to get going. You can find each part of this series by the corresponding git branch or click a link below:
